# BookIT
A something application for Bookmarking but not sure or possibly a Bookmark protocol.

## Expanded Introduction
If you know what Bookmarking is and why use it, the please drop us a few comments in discussion. 

You may be familiar with Bookmarking tools or extensions on Browsers to save a URL of visited websites.  
Then using a Bookmamager of some kind to find past bookmarks. However, I got increaingly frustrated by Bookmark managers and Browsers fro not making the process have saving and managing Bookmarks which can allow to various other features avainable when you visit a wesbite. At least the prower of Cookies, site PUT/GETs/RES etc and much more is possible but only it seams SEARCH engines know more about your Broswer activity then you do. 

Hence, **BootIT**, it kind of a API. (Application Program Interface)

Starting with trying to figure out ALL the ins and out, importing and exporting Bookmarks and developing a stable protocol for any dataset or storage.
Obviouly a JSON or XML is suited but We will see.  

## Usage

To be able to format a Bookmark.html file for importing into Browser, database or csv.
