# BookIT
A something application for Bookmarking but not sure or possibly a Bookmark protocol.

## Expanded Introduction
If you know what Bookmarking is and why to use it, then please drop us a few comments in discussion.

You may be familiar with Bookmarking tools or extensions on Browsers to save a URL of visited websites.  
Then using a Bookmanager of some kind to find past bookmarks. However, I got increasingly frustrated by Bookmark managers and Browsers for not making the process of saving and managing Bookmarks which can allow for various other features available when you visit a website. At least the power of Cookies, site PUT/GETs/RES etc and much more is possible but only it seems SEARCH engines know more about your Browser activity then you do.

Hence, **BootIT**, it is kind of an API. (Application Program Interface)

Starting with trying to figure out ALL the ins and out, importing and exporting Bookmarks and developing a stable protocol for any dataset or storage.
Obviously a JSON or XML is suited but We will see.  

## Usage

To be able to format a Bookmark.html file for importing into Browser, database or csv.
